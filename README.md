# NoteTaking App

A full-stack, scalable NoteTaking application built with modern technologies and best practices, featuring real-time updates, message-driven architecture, and microservice deployment. This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow with React, Django, Flask, Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes, optimized for performance, security, and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and TypeScript for a responsive, user-friendly interface with CRUD functionalities.
- **Backend API**: Django REST Framework handles core CRUD operations for notes, integrated with Kafka to produce messages on create and update events.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Flask microservice acts as a Kafka consumer, processing messages for analytics or other business logic.
- **Message-Driven Design**: Kafka acts as a message broker to facilitate asynchronous processing between Django and Flask, enabling real-time updates and scalability.
- **Security**: Secured API with JWT-based authentication, HTTPS, and CORS policies.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements Redis caching for improved response times, and query optimizations within Django.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized services for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages containerized deployments, with auto-scaling, resource allocation, and monitoring for production readiness.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Axios
- **Backend API**: Django, Django REST Framework, Kafka-python
- **Microservices**: Flask, Kafka-python
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka
- **Cache**: Redis (for caching in Django)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Helm (for production deployment)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider)
- Redis, Kafka, and Zookeeper
- Node.js and Python 3.9

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NoteTakingApp.git
   cd NoteTakingApp
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/api/
   - **Microservice (Flask)**: http://localhost:5000

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: React application
- `backend_django/`: Django REST API for CRUD operations
- `backend_flask/`: Flask microservice consuming Kafka messages
- `kafka_or_rabbitmq/`: Kafka configurations and scripts
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts for environment setup

## Enhancements

- **Advanced Security**: JWT authentication, SSL support, CORS policy.
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries, Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Production-Ready Kafka**: Multi-broker setup with replication and compression for resilience and high throughput.
- **Kubernetes Best Practices**: Resource limits, autoscaling, health probes, and secrets management.
